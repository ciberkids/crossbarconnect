==== DESCRIPTION ====
In these file there are 2 stand alone examples, these permit to publish on a topic subscribed by clients (e.g. authobahn.js) via 
an http post with secret enabled

http://crossbar.io/docs/HTTP-Pusher-Service/
http://crossbar.io/docs/Application-Scenarios/#adding-real-time-to-web-applications

The 2 examples are written in python and php.


I included the crossbar configuration.


== TEST  ==

1) install a your own copy of Crossbar.io

2) write a client that subscribe the topic inseide the examples.

3) launch the crossbar server 

crossbar start

4) and then in another shell launch

python file.py

or

php file.php

the code is very raw but is useful in order to understand how the crossbar.io server wants the data and the format.

I hope to be useful to some one.

Bye
